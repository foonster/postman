## Classes

### EMAIL

A simple class to use the "sendmail" function of the server and supports
local and remote file attachments.

### ANVIL

A collection of functions/methods that have been helpful over the years. Yes, 
there are many built-in PHP functions/methods that now perform many of these same functions.  However, this was written over twenty years and some of these functions/methods were not part of PHP until later and are kept here for historical sake.

### HTML

Yet another HTML rendering class.
